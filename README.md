# Sales Performance Analysis – Revenue by Rep & Lead Source

## Objective  
To analyze the performance of sales representatives and lead sources based on deal volume, revenue, and efficiency.

## Tools Used  
- Google Sheets 
- Excel formulas (VLOOKUP, basic math)  
- Charts: Bar, Column, and Pie  
- Mobile Screenshots for dashboard visual

## Key Metrics Analyzed  
- Revenue per Rep  
- Close Rate (%)  
- Average Revenue per Deal  
- Sales Cycle Duration  
- Lead Source Conversion

## Insights  
- Maya generated the highest revenue ($62K) with a 64% close rate, largely from referrals.  
- LinkedIn leads showed strong conversions and mid-tier sales cycles.  
- Website leads had the slowest cycle and lowest revenue per deal.  
- Reps with higher deal efficiency (like Maya and Chris) performed better even with fewer leads.

## Next Steps / Recommendations  
- Allocate more leads to top performers.  
- Double down on referral and LinkedIn channels.  
- Consider automating outreach for underperforming lead sources.
